## Code of Conduct

This project follows a standard of respectful, inclusive collaboration. Be kind, be constructive, and assume good intentions. Harassment, discrimination, and disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ≥ 18
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) ≥ 10

```bash
# Enable corepack (ships with Node.js)
corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Mster115/the-merkive.git
cd the-merkive
pnpm install

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Verify everything works:

```bash
pnpm test        # All tests should pass
pnpm typecheck   # No TypeScript errors
```

## Project Structure

```
apps/web/                 → Next.js 15 App Router (Stage & Controller shell, API routes)
packages/game-sdk/        → Core plugin contract, deterministic RNG, test harness
packages/games/           → Game plugins + central registry
packages/party/           → PartyKit Edge Room Engine (WebSockets & Durable Objects)
packages/ui/              → Neo-Brutalist Design System (@merky/ui)
market-research/          → Competitive analysis & game design research
CONTRACTS.md              → Platform state semantics & engineering contracts
DESIGN.md                 → Visual design specification
```

### Ownership Zones

| Zone | Who Can Modify | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `packages/games/src/<id>/` | Game authors | Your game plugin lives here |
| `packages/games/src/daily/**` | Game authors | Daily (solo) game plugins — same contributor rules as `packages/games/src/<game_id>/`, contract in `packages/games/src/daily/types.ts` |
| `packages/games/src/index.ts` | Maintainers only | Game registry — request wiring via PR |
| `packages/game-sdk/` | Maintainers only | Plugin contract — changes are rare and policy-gated |
| `packages/ui/` | Maintainers only | Design system components & tokens |
| `packages/party/` | Maintainers only | Edge runtime engine |
| `apps/web/` | Maintainers only | Platform shell, API routes, service layer |
| `scripts/` | Maintainers only | Operational tooling (e.g. the daily content pipeline CLI) |
| `docs/daily-content/` | Content authors & maintainers | How daily puzzle content is written, validated and queued — keep in step with each game's `validatePack` |

> **Rule of thumb**: If you're building a game, you should only need to touch files inside `packages/games/src/<your_game_id>/`.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/Mster115/the-merkive/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Open a new issue with:
   - **Title**: Clear, concise summary
   - **Environment**: Browser, OS, device type (phone/desktop)
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Numbered list
   - **Expected vs. actual behavior**
   - **Screenshots or screen recordings** if applicable
   - **Room code & game** if the bug occurred during gameplay

### Suggesting Features

Open an issue with the `enhancement` label. Include:
- **Problem statement**: What pain point does this solve?
- **Proposed solution**: How should it work?
- **Alternatives considered**: What else did you think about?
- **Scope**: Is this a game plugin, platform feature, or design system change?

### Building a New Game Plugin

This is the most common contribution! Games are self-contained plugins that require **zero changes** to the web shell or API routes.

**Before you start**, read these documents in order:

1. **[Game SDK Guide](packages/game-sdk/README.md)** — the complete plugin contract
2. **[CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md)** — platform state semantics
3. **[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** — visual design system

**File structure for a new game:**

```
packages/games/src/<game_id>/
├── index.tsx              # GameModule export via defineGame(...)
├── logic.ts               # Pure init() and reduce() functions
├── Stage.tsx              # TV display component (StageProps)
├── Controller.tsx         # Phone controller component (ControllerProps)
└── __tests__/
    └── <game_id>.spec.ts  # Unit tests using @merky/game-sdk/testing
```

**Checklist before submitting:**

- [ ] `pnpm test` passes (including the registry test suite)
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` is clean
- [ ] All strings use `t("games.<id>.*")` — no hardcoded English
- [ ] Game logic is pure: no `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or I/O
- [ ] `publicState` contains **no hidden information** (use `privateState` or `secretState`)
- [ ] Stage is readable at 10 ft distance
- [ ] Controller works at 360px width with ≥44px touch targets
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected (no motion-critical UX)

### Improving Existing Games

- Bug fixes, balance tweaks, and UX improvements to existing games are welcome
- Stay within that game's directory (`packages/games/src/<id>/`)
- Don't change the game's `meta.id`, min/max players, or i18n key prefixes without discussion
- Add or update tests for any logic changes

### UI & Design System Contributions

Changes to `packages/ui/` affect every game and the platform shell. These require maintainer review and should be discussed in an issue first. Follow the [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) specification — the neo-brutalist aesthetic is intentional and consistent.

### Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:
- Fix typos, clarify instructions, add examples
- No issue required — just open a PR

Two things are load-bearing rather than descriptive, and go stale silently:
[docs/daily-content/](docs/daily-content/README.md) states the content schemas a
game's `validatePack` enforces, and the daily-fill skills under
[`.claude/skills/daily-merkive-*`](docs/daily-content/scheduled-tasks.md) are the
live instructions three scheduled tasks execute every night. Change a daily
game's payload shape and both must change in the same PR.

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run game tests only
pnpm --filter @merky/games test

# Run platform tests only
pnpm --filter @merky/web test

# Type check everything
pnpm typecheck

# Production build
pnpm build
```

### Testing Your Game

Use the test harness from `@merky/game-sdk/testing`:

```ts
import { createTestMatch, act, actErr, fireTimer, abandonSeat, botStep } from "@merky/game-sdk/testing";

const m = createTestMatch(mygame, { players: 4, seed: "test-1" });

// Player 0 submits an action
act(m, 0, "submit_answer", { text: "hello" });

// Expect player 1's action to be rejected
actErr(m, 1, "invalid_action", {});

// Simulate timer expiry
fireTimer(m);

// Test bot coverage for abandoned seats
abandonSeat(m, 2);
botStep(m);

// Assert on state
expect(m.state.phase).toBe("voting");
expect(m.scores[0]).toBe(100);
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode** is enabled with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` — handle `undefined` on every indexed access
- No `any` types — use proper generics or `unknown`
- Prefer `const` over `let`; never use `var`

### Game Logic Purity

Game `reduce` and `init` functions must be **pure**:

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use `ctx.rng` for randomness | Use `Math.random()` |
| Use `ctx.now` for timestamps | Use `Date.now()` |
| Return fresh state objects | Mutate the incoming `state` |
| Return `{ error, code }` on bad input | Throw exceptions |
| Use `snake_case` for error codes | Use camelCase error codes |

### State Slot Rules

| Slot | Visibility | Use For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `publicState` | All clients | Phase, scores, board state — anything everyone can see |
| `privateState` | Per-seat (only that player) | Card hands, secret prompts, hidden answers |
| `secretState` | Server only (never sent) | Decks, hidden targets, answer keys |

### UI Guidelines

- Use components from `@merky/ui` (`Button`, `Card`, `Panel`, `Pill`, `PlayerChip`)
- Use CSS variables from `packages/ui/src/tokens.css` (`--mb-accent`, `--mb-surface`, etc.)
- Follow the neo-brutalist spec in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md): hard borders, slab shadows, saturated colors
- Don't render global timer bars or scoreboards — the shell handles those

## Architecture & Key Concepts

Understanding these concepts will help you contribute effectively:

- **Server-authoritative**: The server runs all game logic. Clients send intents, the server validates and applies them. This prevents cheating.
- **Plugin architecture**: Games implement the `GameModule` interface from `@merky/game-sdk`. The platform discovers and runs them — no shell modifications needed.
- **Deterministic RNG**: Every `reduce` call gets a seeded RNG derived from `(match seed, state version)`. This makes matches fully replayable.
- **Version CAS**: State updates use compare-and-swap on a version counter. Each applied action bumps the version by exactly 1.
- **Bot coverage**: When a player disconnects, the platform calls `suggestBotAction` for their seat. Bot actions go through `reduce` like any other — bots can't cheat.

For the full details, see [CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md).
